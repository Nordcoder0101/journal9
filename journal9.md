Day 9 Journal

I had an impression that polishing my project would be an easy project.  when I started to debug I ended up in a very
deep rabbit hole and eventually ended up confusing myself more than debugging.  After another hour and a half with my
brother assisting, I was able to get the program working.  Although I am not exactly getting the desired result, I have
learned an incredible lesson in scoping and where and why to define variables within functions.

Overall I am concerened I am far behind on all my projects.  I feel like I am finishing the day before's project 1 day later
and then its hard to find enough time to go back and fix my old projects.  Additionally old assignments seem obsolete
since newer code is doing the same thing but much more efficiently.  Especially literal object creation versus using 
a constructor function.

I will keep working and pushing forward because I am learning and enjoying the process of learning.  Even if I am behind, 
I will not be denied.  One way or another I will learb how to do this.
